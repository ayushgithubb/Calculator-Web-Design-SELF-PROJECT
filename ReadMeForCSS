@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Orbitron&display=swap');: This imports the Orbitron font from Google Fonts and applies it to the calculator.

.calculator { ... }: This is a class selector for the table element that represents the calculator. It sets the padding, border radius, height, width, margin, background color, and box shadow for the calculator.

.display-box { ... }: This is a class selector for the input element that displays the calculator output. It sets the font family, background color, border, color, border radius, width, and height for the display box.

#btn { ... }: This is an ID selector for the clear button on the calculator. It sets the background color for the button.

input:active[type=button] { ... }: This is a selector for all active input elements with type "button". It sets the background color and box shadow for the buttons when they are pressed.
